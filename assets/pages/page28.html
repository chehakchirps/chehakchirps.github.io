    No, I haven’t included the usual “be productive, clean your room, pursue a hobby, do some self care, take some rest” kind of things.<br/><br/>
    These ideas are self-curated, self-experienced or self-thought-of, so do give them a try, and something might click!<br/><br/>

    Also, I’ll let you know of the ideas which I have tried personally, so as to give them a power up from the rest 😛 <br/><br/>
    So read along, I'll be waiting on the other side of the post!
