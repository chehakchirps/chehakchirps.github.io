        <li>Give Voice Overs a shot!</li>
        Most of us must have seen scenes of say Spiderman dubbed in Punjabi, or Harry Potter dubbed in hindi and they are hilarious.<br/><br/>
        Take inspiration from the same and put on any random television channel, or say, the first video that comes up on the youtube homepage,
        mute it and try doing a spontaneous voiceover for the characters on the show or video. <br/><br/>
        It could be a news channel, a daily soap, a movie, anything! Voice over with anyone staying with you, your roommate, 
        your sibling and it will soon turn into a laughter riot.
