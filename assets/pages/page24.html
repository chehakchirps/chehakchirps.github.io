        So now you have a total of 12 habits jotted down right? <br/><br/>
    
        Each week, follow one habit from these 3 categories and continue it for the entire week. 
        For example, you can follow point 1 from all three categories for Week 1, 
        then point 2 from all categories for Week 2 and so on. This gives you a weekâ€™s time to implement
         and figure out how well these habits/activities blend in with your daily schedule. <br/><br/>
    
        It is the end of week 4, and you have successfully tried out 12 habits/activities. 
        Now, you have two more days 30th and 31st January. Use them to figure out one habit from each category
        that stole the show and try out your curated habits
