        <li>Do a group voice note chat!</li>
        Okay, don’t judge already, just hear me out. 
        Video group chats and text chats are something that most of us may have already explored but audio chats open up an 
        entire new region of creativity when it comes to chats. Invent your own group games, like for example, I remember being
         part of a game wherein each of my friends would send a voice note of a sound that they made or made using an article in 
         their house and the others had to guess what made that sound.
