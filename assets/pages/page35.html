      <li>Favourite Celebrity Challenge!</li>
      Choose your favourite celebrity(actor, author, singer) and find one movie, publication, song or work of theirs that isn’t spoken of much and try seeing,
      reading or listening to it!<br/><br/> You’ll either find another good work of your favourite celebrity or a good piece of junk to laugh about and question your choice.

      <li>Go 90’s!</li>
  Try out games that you used to play in the 90’s: Stone-Paper-Scissor, Name-Place-Animal-Thing, Snakes-and-Ladders, the ever old newspaper game and you’ll all 
  realise that these are games nobody can ever outgrow.
