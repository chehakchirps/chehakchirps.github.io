        It’s something to fall back upon, 
        many times, probably when my days isn’t going as planned, or when I want some time, or when I want to cut off for a while.

        I remember surfing the internet as a kid to find lyrics of songs that I liked so that I could by heart them,
         I know of friends who used to used Bollywood music tunes and changed lyrics to make their own songs. 
        I remember sitting down with my friends and changing lyrics of “Batameez Dil”, in particular, for our school farewell song too.
