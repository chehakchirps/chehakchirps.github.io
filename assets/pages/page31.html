        <li>Document your best, recent memory!</li>
        Documentation could be in any form! It could be a write up or a blog post..
        You could also just create an audio note talking about how you felt about that memory.
        You can dig out photos and videos of a memorable time/day/trip and create a trip documentary by combining them.
        A friend of mine recently created a video about our most recent trip its been playing on loop ever since!<br/><br/>
        
        Reminiscing a good memory always cheers up everyone and is a good way to send away and quarantine related negative vibes.
        
        Also, this time isnâ€™t going to last forever. So plan for your next vacation, how much ever far it may be, it will definitely bring a smile to your face.
