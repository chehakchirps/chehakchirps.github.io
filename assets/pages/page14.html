 From bathroom singing in our worst voices, to enjoying radio songs while going for work, playing earphone music while traveling in a bus or cab, to
  loud stereo music while on a road trip, to Sunday morning songs in your house, to concert and music fests, 
 to using music as a background while at work while you study, I’m sure most of us relate to at least one of these scenes from everyday life.

     At any random point of time in my life I’m doing at least one of the following – 
     singing, humming, playing, listening or simply curating- music. Think about it, maybe you are too!
     Music is one thing that has always been a constant source of satisfaction for me.
