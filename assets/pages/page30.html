        <li>Create an ambience!</li>
    Staying at home can be boring. Especially for those who love going out. So make staying indoors fun by prepping it up. <br/><br/>
    A good ambience can mean different things for different people. Good lighting using low light lamps or fairy lights, comfortable seating, 
    over the top poster walls, loud peppy music, lots of food preparations, airy and bright sun-lit rooms.<br/><br/>
     Whatever brings you in your best spirit, make sure your indoor space matches your vibe, so it is inviting enough to make you want to stay indoors. </p>
