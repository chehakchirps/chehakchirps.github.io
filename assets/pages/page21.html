       <blockquote>But a lot of us already try new things in Jan! What is the difference in what you suggest?</blockquote><br/>
       Well, I intend to treat January like a trial month. Like how memberships have a free trial month in the beginning? 
       Somewhat similar to that. Utilise January to try out a plethora of things and observe the impact these new things/habits have on your life, 
       then enroll for a membership!

       So here is the game plan:<br />
   
       January 2020 consists consists of roughly 4 weeks if we begin from January 1, right?<br/>
           
               Jan 1 – Jan 8<br/>
               Jan 9 – Jan 15<br/>
               Jan 16 – Jan 22<br/>
               Jan 23 – Jan 29 <br/>
           
   
   And well, Jan 30 and 31st can be kept for a month review.
