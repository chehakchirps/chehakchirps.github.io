      You tend to indulge more in lyrically appealing songs when you are undergoing an emotional meltdown or groovy songs when youâ€™re in a party mood.

      I tried a new thing though. <br /><br/>
      Rather than choosing songs according to the mood I was in, I chose songs according to the mood I WANTED myself to be in, at a particular moment.
      Let your music lead you into the kind of mood you wish to be in. Trust me it works beautifully. <br/>

      Going through a mental turmoil? Do not go for sad songs, rather choose soothing tracks.
