  combination for these next two days, and Voila! 
     you have successfully decided on 3 good habits that change your life for the better and are ready for
      permanent enrollment to those habits. 
  </p>
  <p>
      Most of the times, we are inspired to inculcate certain habits as we see influencers do them, 
      a friend recommended it to us or we read about it somewhere!

      We blindly think of following it in our lives. What we fail to consider is that each of us have unique lifestyles.
      It is a given that the habits you have heard of have worked well for somebody, but it is only fair to first try them 
      out with your routine, before enforcing them onto your life.
