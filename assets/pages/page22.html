        Go ahead and chalk out 4 different habits or activities or mantras that you wish to try out pertaining to these 3 categories.
        This may be something that you think might boost your productivity, well being, knowledge, interaction with colleagues, 
        improve visibility, personal growth, sanctity etc. Iâ€™ll give you an example:

       
            <li>Work/Career</li>
            <ol>
                <li style="margin-top: 0px; font-weight: normal !important; color: black !important;">Reaching Office early every day.</li>
                <li style="margin-top: 0px; font-weight: normal !important; color: black !important;">Taking a 5 minute rejuvenation break every 2 hours.</li>
                <li style="margin-top: 0px; font-weight: normal !important; color: black !important;">1 hours for Self Learning each day.</li>
