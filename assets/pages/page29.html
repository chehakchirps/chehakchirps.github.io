        <li>Community Games To the Rescue!</li> 
        It can be any game that can be played remotely with your friends. While pubg may be the most popular one, try finding other less known games for variety. 
        <br/><br/>My personal choice would be “skribbl.io”. <br/><br/>No credits to me for this, it was recommended by a friend and can be played with a private gameroom for your set of friends. 
        <br/><br/>This is a recent discovery and trust me it’s hilarious to see your friend’s drawing skills in this timed drawing game!
